GISProject
==========

This is the project I am doing in Purdue Discovery Park with Prof. Nicole

The purpose of this project is to develop a web-based map to visualize natural resources data. The developed map will serve as an active interface to enhance ecosystem management, research prioritization, and education planning. Various GIS layers (e.g., vegetation cover, soil, roads, etc.) are available to describe research properties managed by the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources. In this project, we will link the data and maps, and create an active visualization system to display these properties. We will also develop data models to add additional information to these maps to reflect ongoing research and management activities and potential research opportunities. The final product will be a website hosted at Purdue University Libraries as a resource for teaching, extension and research activities.
